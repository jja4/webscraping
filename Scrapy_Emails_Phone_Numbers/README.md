## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Things required to get started:
1. Download Miniconda3
(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers)
2. Download Git Bash (https://gitforwindows.org/)
3. Clone repository by opening Git Bash, change directories (cd) to the desired install
location/path (perhaps your Documents folder), then:
  ```python
  git clone https://gitlab.cloud.eemagine.com/jaftreth/bdp-code.git
  ```
4. Change directories (cd) to Scrapy_Emails_Phone_Numbers folder
  ```python
  cd Scrapy_Emails_Phone_Numbers
  ```
5. Install all required packages, open Anaconda Prompt, then:
  ```python
  conda env create -n bdp --file environment.yml
  ```
6. Activate the BDP environment
  ```python
  conda activate bdp
  ```
7. Run the following command to install a language processing AI model
  ```python
  python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm --user
  ```
### Basic Usage
1. If not already open, open Anaconda prompt, then:
```python
conda activate bdp
```
2. cd to the location/path where the repository was installed (don’t copy exactly below)
```python
cd path/to/bdp-code/Scrapy_Emails_Phone_Numbers
```
3. Start the scrapy crawler script:
```python
scrapy crawl emailspider -o output.csv
```
Alternative commands
To overwrite an existing output.csv file
```python
scrapy crawl emailspider -O output.csv
```
To save to a new file with a different name
```python
scrapy crawl emailspider -o new_name.csv
```
4. Start the search with your google search query. For example:
```python
eeg companies germany
```

### Advanced Usage
To change the number of Google search results pages to scrape:
On Line ~43 of emailspider.py, change “results_pages_to_scrape = 1” to
“results_pages_to_scrape = 5“ or another number other than 5
To update the code to the latest version:
1. Open Git Bash, change directory to the Scrapy Tool project:
```python
cd ‘/path/to/bdp-code/Scrapy_Emails_Phone_Numbers’
```
2. Download the new code
```python
git pull
```
3. Open Anaconda Prompt, update the environment by:
```python
conda activate bdp
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
### Keywords to use:
To search for phone numbers, use these keywords:

Phone number, contact, telephone, +49 or other relevant country codes

For emails:

Email, contact

For prices:

Price, product code, cost

To search for company revenues, use these keywords:

Revenue, financials, annual report, investments or income statement

The search and crawling process will take quite a while as it retrieves maximum results from Google & try to crawl all of them.
After the process finished, you can see output in specified file

## Troubleshooting
If you run into the problem where the scrapy code executes, but you do not get any results,
with output similar to this:

Here is the solution:

Open the settings.py file in
“bdp-code\Scrapy_Emails_Phone_Numbers\emailcrawler\settings.py”

On line 20 or so, change:

USER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.100 Safari/537.36'

to

USER_AGENT = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.82 Safari/537.36'

Save the file, and try again.

If still having trouble try a higher number like 91.0.4389.82 until it works again. The first
number should be between 61 and 113, these are the versions of Chrome.
